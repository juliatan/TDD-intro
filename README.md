RSpec and Ruby Exercises
========================

Exercises done as part of learning Test Driven Development (through RSpec) and to further develop Ruby programming knowledge.

FizzBuzz
--------

The aim of this exercise was to develop the FizzBuzz program using TDD. The FizzBuzz program replaces any number divisible by 3 with 'Fizz', any number divisible by 5 with 'Buzz', and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with 'FizzBuzz'. All other numbers remain unchanged and returns itself.

### How to use FizzBuzz

```shell
require './lib/fizzbuzz'
fizzbuzz(number)
```

Roman Numerals
--------------

The aim of this exercise was to develop a Roman Numerals converter using TDD. The Roman Numerals program takes in a number and converts it into a roman numeral.

### How to use Roman Numerals

```shell
require './lib/roman_numerals'
RomanNumerals.convert(number)
```

Student Directory
--------------------

The aim of this exercise was to rebuild the Student Directory project that was completed in Week 1 at Makers Academy, using TDD and RSpec.

### How to use Student Directory

```shell
ruby lib/directory.rb
```
